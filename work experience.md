### Team Management  
1. Be careful about picking teammates, tell your idea and estimated time needed to commit as a team. Talk at least 30 minutes to make sure that the person you talk to can understand the problem correctly and have enough time to commit. At the end of the project, don't hire new teammates because the communication expense is expensive.  
2. Do not waste time to complain irresponsible teammates. Do things to the limit, get some results, and then set a precise seive, collaborate with responsible people who got results before. If can't get results, keep trying things to the limit, don't team up with someone just because of in a hurry of getting results.

### Work Method
1. Careful, loogical, and rigorous. In a competitive market, if do 99 things right and one thing wrong, users will remember the wrong one, and select other competitors.  
2. Be creative when looking for approaches, but only report results to boss.  
3. If not sure about the problem, ask it until clear.  
4. Dig the hidden reasons behind abnormal data.  Sometimes the data is wrong, needed to be update; Sometimes the meat of data analysis is there.

### Adding value by learning
1. According to Bloom's Taxonomy, pyramid is remember < understand < apply < analyze < evaluate < create.
2. The center of value is people's needs, domain knowledge is the bridge between learning and value.
3. There are two approaches to add value, one is bottom-up, learn as much as one can, remember more, apply more, some things will work; the other way is top-bottom, know what's the need, what solution will meet the need, and what skills are needed to ensure this solution doable, and learn the skill.
4. Even I was a data analyst intern, I added team value by this way: When I need to copy the word cloud a senior data analyst did before in a new dashboard, I recall a word cloud my classmate presented a year ago, and I had some ideas about word cloud. 10 months ago, I read the bood <story telling with data>, and understood how to use color comparison to provide more clear visualization. This time when I saw the word cloud, there are too many words, and the theme is patients' satisfaction, so I thought the nouns are not important because it's hard to show patients' satisfaction by noun words they said, adj are important, so I used testBlob library in python to label each word, show positive words as green, neutral words as grey, and negative words as red. My director asked me to tell colleagues how to do that in case I need to go back to school due to CPT and he wants to do it continously in future.
5. Line of code doesn't equal to value, a complex model may produce useless conclusion and this textblob code is less than 20 lines, but used new skill to add value to our team by providing more clear information for clinic leaderships.
