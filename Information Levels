Information can be deduced from the physical and chemical properties at the bottom, up to the second layer, through many layers, revealing sociological, psychological, and other phenomena, and through many more layers, revealing a variety of human activities.
For example, the cause of Romeo's heart pounding when he sees Juliet can be traced down to the physiological cause, which is that he secretes a lot of dopamine. And why dopamine is secreted can be traced back down to the physical principle of neurotransmitter transmission.
If we can know Romeo's genes, the instinctive algorithm of Romeo's brain, the match between Juliet's genes and his, we can deduce how much dopamine he will secrete and work our way up to deduce what behavior he will do.
Predicting by correlating things to each other is usually using one phenotype to predict another. If the underlying information can be known, then no prediction is needed because it can be deduced.  

Researchers create new methods, data scientists implete methods in a particular situation. In a given situation, many information changed, that's the problems a good enginner need to fix.
