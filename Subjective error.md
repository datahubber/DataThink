If the behavior and choices of each individual could be digitized, the overall benefit to society would be greatly enhanced. For example, if a person wants to learn some skills to become a data scientist, a system could allow him to assess his current level through a few hours of testing, and then dynamically present what the input-output ratio is for each skill, and he could get a job faster by choosing the skill with a higher output ratio to learn.
