If an alien look at pyramid from top, he could recognize it as a square.  
If a human look at pyramid form one side, he could recognize it as a triangle.  
There is an old Chinese poem that says, "横看成岭侧成峰"， means that look a thing from different direction, the conclusion could be different.  
How does this phenomenon demonstrate in data?  
Accurate data do not lie (inaccuracy stems from the subjectivity of the statistician or from a lack of objectivity in statistical ability)  
But one-sided (inaccurate) data can easily mislead to false conclusions.  
When comparing the all-age(figure1) and 45+(figure2) HIV rates by county, it is easy to conclude that "older people have more life experience and therefore have higher rates of disease".

However, the data in Figure 2 is not accurate, but only averages the prevalence rate of 45-54 years old with that of 55 years old and above in each county. When the data are further refined and weighted by the number of people in each age group (45-54: 55+ = 40 million: 98 million = 3:7) and combined with the age-specific prevalence rates, the overall prevalence rate decreases slightly(figure3). If, as just concluded, the older age 55+ weight becomes higher, the data should be elevated. This suggests that the 45-54 age group has a higher prevalence rate than 55+.  
If we look at the history, we can see that the 1990s was the decade of the surge of AIDS patients in the United States, and people who are now around 50 years old were in their strongest years at that time. So the conclusion can be modified to "Young people in the years of the AIDS surge have a higher prevalence of the disease due to excessive risk-taking (injections, etc.)."  
It is not difficult to analyze a logical cause from a result. Because an outcome results from the cumulative effect of multiple causes, if there are seven positive influences and three negative factors and the outcome is positive, it is easy to identify one of the seven positive factors. But on the contrary, it is difficult to find all 10 influencing factors and predict the result accurately, many times just find 2 positive factors and 1 negative factor, masked right.
