What is dimensionality?  
To make it easy, let me take an example of a college students who is choosing courses for next semester, what attributes of courses might he consider?  
1. Content - whether this course is beneficial to his career path  
2. Workload - How much time he would put  
That's the foundamental two dimension decision model, every animal's behavior is based on cost and benefit.
That's easy, but if he make ascending dimension:  
1.1 Professor score  
1.2 Syllabus  
1.3 relenvance to interest  
1.4 graduation requirement  
2.1 how many hours needed to spend per week  
2.2 schedule conflict  
2.3 difficulty  
2.4 onsite/online, commute time
